> **NOTE** I have discontinued work on this repository in favor of my other project,  [classic-grooming](https://github.com/codechaotic/classic-grooming).

Experimental scaffold for a website built using Node and Angular.js, deployed using Docker, assembled using Webpack, and tested using Karma and Protractor.

### About this project
This web application serves a simple Angular.js single-page app which connects to a MongoDB backend datastore through an exposed JSON API.

### Usage

Please note that this is not intended for general usage and is flawed and for production purposes, unusable. But it fuctions as a good demonstration for using Webpack to build server and client code. It also makes a good example of how NOT to organize your server code.
